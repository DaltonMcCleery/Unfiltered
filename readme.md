# Unfiltered Ninjas

The hilarious, say-anything-you-want party game!

- **No Censorship** (say *whatever* you want!)
- **No Boundaries** (All subject matter and topic are welcome!)
- **No Hard Feelings?** (Someone is probably going to make fun of your Mother, sorry!)

## How to Play

The main parts of playing the Unfiltered Ninjas game are:
- Question Ninja
- Answer Time
- Picking a Round Winner

The Game will start by selecting a **Question Ninja**. The Question Ninja will have a set
amount of time to write out a open-ended question for all of the other Ninja's in the game
to answer (Don't write yes/no questions - those suck).

Once the Question Ninja has submitted their question to the other Ninjas, they will have a set
amount of time to write the funniest, edgy, obscure, and *unfiltered* answer possible to the question.

Once all Ninjas have posted their Answer, or the timer has ran out, the Question Ninja will be
shown all of the Answers (sorted randomly) **without** showing them who wrote the Answer!

The Question Ninja will then pick which Answer they thought was the best or the funniest; whichever
Ninja wrote that Answer will be awarded **1 point**! The Ninja who was selected as the round winner
will then become the Question Ninja for the next round.

First Ninja to win 3 rounds wins the entire Game!
